# npm â€“ The Node Package Manager

npm is a little package manager for the Node javascript library.

For now, this README is more of a task list/roadmap than a proper "how to use this" type doc.

## Status: alpha

This thing is a baby yet.  But these kids grow up before you know it!  Pretty soon, you'll be all tapping out your pipe on the front porch, saying in your withered old man voice, <i>"I remember back before the war with the machines, when that npm thing couldn't even install itself, and didn't know what a version was.  We used promises for everything and the global object was called 'node'.  Movies were a nickel when we downloaded them from from the micro torrents, and soda pop had corn syrup of the highest fructose imaginable.  You youngins don't know how good you got it."</i>

This isn't even beta, it's alpha.  When most of the core functionality is working, I'll make an announcement on the [node.js](http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs) list.  That'll be the `0.1.0` version.

Here's what I mean by "core functionality":

1. Install packages by name, and get the stable version.
2. Install packages by supplying a name and version, and get the version specified.
3. Install more than one package at a time by specifying them all on the command line.
4. Install pre-requisites automatically, pulling the stable versions of the dependencies.
5. Talk to a centralized repository to do all this package/version lookup magic.
6. Install more than one version of a package, and optionally select an "active" version.
7. Safely uninstall packages, not removing them unless they have no dependents.  (Override with a `--force` flag, of course.)
8. Provide a utility for uploading a package.json to a js-registry repository.
9. Handle circular dependencies nicely.
10. Install and activate automatically.
11. Read settings from a .npmrc file.
12. Be much smarter about cli arguments.
13. Help topics.
14. Install a "link" to a dev directory, so that it links it in rather than doing the moveIntoPlace step.
15. Detect when a package has only been installed as a dependency, and be able to remove it when nothing else depends on it.

## Principles

Put the files where they need to be so that node can find them using the methods it already uses.

Be easy, not clever.

The file system is the database.

Sync with the habits that are already in use.

Packages should be maintained by their authors, not by the package manager author.  (Especially if that's me, because I'm lazy.)

Run it on node.  Cuz a node package manager should be written in evented javascript.

## Contributing

If you're interested in helping, that's awesome!  Please fork this project, implement some of the things on the list, and then let me know.  You can usually find me in #node.js on freenode.net, or you can reach me via <i@izs.me>.

If you have strong feelings about package managers, I'd love to hear your opinions.

## Installation

To install npm, do this:

    $ node install-npm.js

That will use npm to install itself, like [Ouroboros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros).  From there, you can call the command line program which is cleverly named `npm`.

## What works now:

These are the commands that actually do things, as of today.  If they don't do what they say they do, then please post an issue about it.

### install

    npm install <tarball>

This installs the package, where `tarball` is a url or path to a `.tgz` file that contains a package with a `package.json` file in the root.

This'll create some stuff in `$HOME/.node_libraries`.  It supports installing multiple versions of the same thing.

From here, you can do `require("foo-1.2.3")` where "foo" is the name of the package, and "1.2.3" is the version you installed.

Installing by name and version alone is planned for the next version.

### uninstall

    npm uninstall <name> <version>

This uninstalls a package, completely removing everything installed for it.  If it's currently active, then it must be deactivated first.  If anything is depending on it, then those must be uninstalled first.

### activate

    npm activate <name> <version>

This "activates" a specific version of a package, so that you can just do `require("foo")` without having to specify the version.

### deactivate

    npm deactivate <name>

If there's an active version of the package, this will unlink it from that preferential position.

### link

    npm link <folder>

This will link a source folder into npm's registry using a symlink, and then build it according to the package.json file in that folder's root.  This is handy for installing your own stuff, so that you can work on it and test it iteratively without having to continually rebuild.

### list

    npm list [package]

This will show the installed (and, potentially, activated) versions of all the packages that npm has installed, or just the `package` if specified.

This is also aliased to `ls`.

## Package Lifecycle Scripts

npm supports the "scripts" member of the package.json script, for the following scripts:

`preinstall` - Run BEFORE the package is installed

`install` - Run AFTER the package is installed.

`preactivate` - Run BEFORE the package is activated.

`activate` - Run AFTER the package has been activated.

`deactivate` - Run BEFORE the package is deactivated.

`postdeactivate` - Run AFTER the package is deactivated.

`uninstall` - Run BEFORE the package is uninstalled.

`postuninstall` - Run AFTER the package is uninstalled.

### Package Lifecycle Env Vars

Package scripts are run in an environment where the package.json fields have been tacked onto the `npm_package_` prefix.  So, for instance, if you had `{"name":"foo", "version":"1.2.5"}` in your package.json file, then in your various lifecycle scripts, this would be true:

    process.env.npm_package_name === "foo"
    process.env.npm_package_version === "1.2.5"

Objects are flattened following this format, so if you had `{"scripts":{"install":"foo.js"}}` in your package.json, then you'd see this in the script:

    process.env.npm_package_scripts_install = "foo.js"

Last but not least, the `npm_lifecycle_event` environment variable is set to whichever stage of the cycle is being executed.  So, you could have a single script used for different parts of the process which switches based on what's currently happening.

If the script exits with a code other than 0, then this will abort the process.

Note that these script files don't have to be nodejs or even javascript programs.  They just have to be some kind of executable file.

For example, if your package.json contains this:

    { "scripts" : 
      { "install" : "scripts/install.js"
      , "postinstall" : "scripts/install.js"
      , "activate" : "scripts/install.js"
      , "uninstall" : "scripts/uninstall.js"
      }
    }

then the `scripts/install.js` will be called for the install, post-install, and activate stages of the lifecycle, and the `scripts/uninstall.js` would be called when the package is uninstalled.

## Deviations from and Extensions to the Packages/1.0 Spec

npm aims to implement the commonjs [Packages](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0) spec.  However, some adjustments have been made, which may eventually be unmade, but hopefully will be incorporated into the spec.

### version

Version must be [semver](http://semver.org)-compliant.  npm assumes that you've read the semver page, and that you comply with it.  Versions packages with non-semver versions will not be installed by npm.  It's just too tricky if you have more than one way to do it, and semver works well.

(This is actually mentioned in the Packages/1.0 spec, but it's worth mentioning that npm enforces this requirement quite strictly, since it's pretty liberal about most other things.)

### dependencies

The Packages/1.0 spec's method for specifying dependencies is Unclean in My Sight.  So, npm is using a very simple semver-based method.

Dependencies are specified with a simple hash of package name to version range.  The version range is EITHER a string with has one or more space-separated descriptors.

Version range descriptors may be any of the following styles, where "version" is a semver compatible version identifier.

1. `version` Must match `version` exactly
2. `=version` Same as just `version`
3. `>version` Must be greater than `version`
4. `>=version` etc
5. `<version`
6. `<=version`
7. `*` Matches any version
8. `""` (just an empty string) Same as `*`
9. `version1 - version2` Same as `>=version1 <=version2`.

For example, these are all valid:

    { "dependencies" : 
      { "foo" : "1.0.0 - 2.9999.9999"
      , "bar" : ">=1.0.2 <2.1.2"
      , "baz" : ">1.0.2 <=2.3.4"
      , "boo" : "2.0.1"
      }
    }

### link

You may specify a `link` member in your package.json to have npm link dependencies in to a particular location inside your package dir.  For example:

    { "dependencies" : 
      { "boo" : "2.0.1"
      , "baz" : ">1.0.2 <=2.3.4"
      , "foo" : "1.0.0 - 2.9999.9999"
      , "bar" : ">=1.0.2 <2.1.2"
      }
    , "link" : 
      { "boo" : "./deps/boo"
      , "baz" : "./lib/baz"
      , "foo" : "./deps/foo"
      , "bar" : "./deps/bar"
      }
    }

This would link the dependencies into the specified locations, so that the package code could do `require("./deps/foo")` to import whichever version of `foo` was satisfying the requirement.

<strong style="color:red">Warning!</strong> This is currently the *only* way in which npm modifies the pristine nature of the package directory, and it may go away eventually.  It's just that it satisfies a use case that is pretty tricky to do otherwise.

### engines

Packages/1.0 says that you can have an "engines" field with an array of engine names.  However, it has no provision for specifying which version of the engine your stuff runs on.

With npm, you can use either of the following styles to specify the version of node that your stuff works on:

    { "engines" : [ "node >=0.1.27 <0.1.30" ] }

or:

    { "engines" : { "node" : ">=0.1.27 <0.1.30" } }

And, like with dependencies, if you don't specify the version (or if you specify "*" as the version), then any version of node will do.

If you specify an "engines" field, then npm will require that "node" be somewhere on that list.  If "engines" is omitted, then npm will just assume that it works on node.

### bin

A lot of packages have one or more executable files that they'd like to install into the PATH.  npm makes this pretty easy (in fact, it uses this feature to install the "npm" executable.)

To use this, supply a `bin` field in your package.json which is a map of command name to local file name.  On install, npm will link that file into place right next to wherever node is installed.  (Presumably, this is in your PATH, and defaults to `/usr/local/bin`.)  On activation, the versioned file will get linked to the main filename (just like how the main.js stuff works, but with an executable in the PATH.)

For example, npm has this:

    { "bin" : { "npm" : "./cli" } }

So, when you install npm, it'll create a symlink from the `cli.js` script to `/usr/local/bin/npm-version`.  Then, when you activate that version, it'll create a symlink from `/usr/local/bin/npm-version` to `/usr/local/bin/npm`.

## Todo

All the "core functionality" stuff above.  Most immediately:

* Install packages from the registry.  Implement a "fetch" command that writes to `.npm/{pkg}/{version}/package.json`.
* Install missing dependencies.  For each one, fetch it, then figure out what it needs, then fetch that if we don't already have it, etc.  Put off the resolveDependencies step until everything on the list has been installed, then go back and do the dependency linking.
* Uninstall dependent packages.

Some "nice to have" things that aren't quite core:

* Use path.relative so that the whole root can be picked up and moved easily.
* Specify the root (and other global options, perhaps) to the CLI.
* Parse command line options better, and pass an object to the npm command functions, rather than having everything just take one or two positional arguments.

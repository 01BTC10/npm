# npm â€“ The Node Package Manager

npm is a little package manager for the Node javascript library.

For now, this README is more of a task list/roadmap than a proper "how to use this" type doc.

## Contributing

If you're interested in helping, that's awesome!  Please fork this project, implement some of the things on the list, and then let me know.  You can usually find me in #node.js on freenode.net, or you can reach me via <i@izs.me>.

## What works now:

In a nodejs program:

    require("./npm").install(tarball)

on the command line:

    ./cli.js install <tarball>

This installs the package, where `tarball` is a url or path to a `.tgz` file that contains a package with a `package.json` file in the root.

This'll create some stuff in `$HOME/.node_libraries`.  It supports installing multiple versions of the same thing.  Version activation, dependency resolution, and registry awareness are planned next.

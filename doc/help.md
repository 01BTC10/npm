npm-help(1) -- Get help about npm commands
==========================================

## SYNOPSIS

    npm help <section>

Where `<section>` is one of:  
`activate`, `adduser`, `build`, `config`, `deactivate`, `folders`, `help`
(this page), `install`, `json`, `link` (or `ln`), `list` (or `ls`), `npm`,
`publish`, `registry`, `scripts`, `tag`, `uninstall` (or `rm`)

Note that you can get the exact same help content by doing:

    man npm-<section>

## Todo

It'd be nice if this page was automatically generated.
